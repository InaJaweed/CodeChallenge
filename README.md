## Some Thoughts and Considerations

### What challenges did you face?
- The main challenge was to implement the API and frontend in a way that they could work together. I had to ensure that the API was correctly implemented and that the frontend could interact with it to submit and fetch data. I also had to consider how to store the data and how to display it in the frontend. I faced many different challenges such as handling user input, displaying data, and ensuring that the API was working correctly. I also had to consider how to structure the data and how to handle errors. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding experience.

### What would you improve if this were a real product?
- If this were a real product, I would improve the error handling and validation in the API to provide better feedback to users. I would also add more features to the frontend, such as pagination, search, and filtering options. Additionally, I would enhance the design and user experience of the frontend to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Ensure more robust unit tests and integration tests to ensure the quality of the code. Finally, I would consider adding third party api integration to fetch more data and provide more information to the users.

### What did you learn from this challenge?
- I learned how to create a REST API using C# and .NET  and how to interact with it using a frontend framework using react. I also learned how to structure and display data in a frontend application and how to handle user input and interactions. I also learned how to store data in-memory and how to retrieve and display it in the frontend. Overall, I learned a lot about full-stack development and how to create a simple web application from scratch.
