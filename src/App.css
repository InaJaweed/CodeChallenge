/* Look at the screen shot I sent before on how my frontend looks. I want to change how it looks by making the Title and UserForm which is in the AddMediaForm.tsx file to be placed at the top center of the page.

and currently if you look the way I display the movies/tvshows is throught tables I want to change that into a simple grid format like a shopping product page in a Card form. So they are displayed next to each other. */
